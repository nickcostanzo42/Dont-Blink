2.  Create a function that starts random card flipping
  -Will randomly cause doors to have 5s, 4s, and 3s durations on animation time
  and have a specific image associated with each.
  -Create innate onclick functions on each door that will remove the
  associated animation class
  -Max of 4 doors opening at a time
    -Do this with a counter, adding a counter everytime a door is spawned
    and removing one every time
