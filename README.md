# Dont-Blink

Project 1 - GA - HTML/CSS/JS+jQuery game

Description/MVP:

The game's idea is based of the popular steam game 'Five Nights at Freddie's.' It will be centric around one browser window that contains 'door' objects that open at different intervals to reveal images of 'spooky-faces.'

The different images will be tied to objects that reveal themselves faster. As the user stays in the game longer, the shorter interval images will spawn more frequently.

There is no way to 'win' the game, but there will be a high-score table that's based off of the time spent in the game.


Approach:

The game uses HTML and CSS to create and edit all of the elements on the page.  It then uses JS
and jQuery to open the doors randomly and allow the user to close them as well.  There will be 3 (TBD) speeds that doors open at, they will start opening faster as the game progresses.  

User Stories:

The user should be clickingxs
