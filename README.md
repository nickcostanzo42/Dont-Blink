# Dont-Blink

Project 1 - GA - HTML/CSS/JS game

Description:

The game's idea is based of the popular steam game 'Five Nights at Freddie's.' It will be centric around one browser window that contains 'door' objects that open at different intervals to reveal images of 'spooky-faces.'

The different images will be tied to objects that reveal themselves faster. As the user stays in the game longer, the shorter interval images will spawn more frequently.

There is no way to 'win' the game, but there will be a high-score table that's based off of the time spent in the game.
